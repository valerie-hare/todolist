# todolist
For my Front End Web Development II class, I built a simple to-do list that adds new tasks. Users can edit these tasks using contentEditable elements. I used jQuery sortable so users can sort the tasks. A combination of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and Bootstrap 4 was used to build this to-do list.
